  -- Below is the main logic of figuring out how to execute tests. In short,
  -- a "runspec" is defined for each command to execute.
  -- Neotest also distinguishes between different "position types":
  -- - "dir": A directory of tests
  -- - "file": A single test file
  -- - "namespace": A set of tests, collected under the same namespace
  -- - "test": A single test
  --
  -- If a valid runspec is built and returned from this function, it will be
  -- executed by Neotest. But if, for some reason, this function returns nil,
  -- Neotest will call this function again, but using the next position type
  -- (in this order: dir, file, namespace, test). This gives the ability to
  -- have fallbacks.
  -- For example, if a runspec cannot be built for a file of tests, we can
  -- instead try to build a runspec for each individual test file. The end
  -- result would in this case produce multiple commands to execute (for each
  -- test) rather than one command for the file.
  -- The idea here is not to have such fallbacks take place in the future, but
  -- while this adapter is being developed, it can be useful to have such
  -- functionality.
